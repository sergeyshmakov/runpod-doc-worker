"""Every Python file stays under a line cap, checked rather than hoped for.

The cap exists because this repository grew several files past the point where
anyone reads one whole -- a 1,203-line client module and a 2,113-line test file for
it, each of which turned out to hold six or eight separable subjects. Splitting them was
straightforward once someone looked; the problem was that nothing prompted anyone
to look. A failing test does.

The number is a convention, not a discovery. What matters is that crossing it is a
decision someone makes deliberately, by editing this file, rather than something
that happens over thirty commits.
