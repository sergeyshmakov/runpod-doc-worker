"""Reading a worker's response safely: archives, filenames, base64 payloads.

Every function here treats the response as untrusted. That is not paranoia about
the worker — an archive extractor which trusts member names is a path-traversal
bug (CVE-2007-4559) regardless of who wrote the archive, and a ``transport="s3"``
result is fetched from a URL rather than read out of the response body.

**Why this lives in the harness.** It did not, and that cost real bugs. Each
consumer repo shipped its own copy of these helpers — one as ``_``-prefixed
private functions inside its client module, another lifted into a separate
module — so hardening one copy left the other untouched. Three fixes made in one
client (malformed tar, corrupt zip, and network failures escaping the client's own
error type) never reached the four identical sites in the other, and neither
validated base64 at all. Shared here, a fix lands once for every consumer,
including the next one.

Nothing in this module imports the rest of the harness, and nothing outside the
standard library — so importing it costs nothing at runtime beyond what Python has
already loaded.

That is a claim about imports, not about installation, and an earlier draft of this
docstring overstated it. Installing this distribution brings httpx and httpcore,
because the worker side declares them, and pip does that for anyone who depends on
it including a client that touches none of it. Putting those behind an extra would
change what every existing worker installs, so the trade is deliberate: the
alternative is a second distribution, which costs a whole release pipeline to save
two wheels.
