"""Outbound target checks for the URL-shaped job inputs.

A job input can carry URLs the worker acts on: the document to fetch, and —
for engines that can talk to a model server instead of loading weights
in-process — where that server lives. Both arrive as free-form strings, so a
typo reaches the network stack and comes back as a socket error 120 seconds
later, or as an httpx protocol complaint that doesn't say which field was
wrong.

This module turns such a string into a checked target first, so the job fails
immediately with a message naming the field:

* ``require_http_url`` — the shape check: a scheme the worker speaks, and a
  host to connect to. This is all ``server_url`` needs; where an operator
  points their own model server is their call.
* ``resolve_checked`` — additionally resolves the host and requires the answer
  to be a publicly routable address, which is what a document URL passed to a
  serverless worker is in practice. ``<PREFIX>_ALLOW_LOCAL_FETCH=1`` lifts that
  requirement for local development and for operators serving documents from a
  host inside their own network. The prefix is the worker's own — see
  :mod:`runpod_doc_worker.config`.
* ``CheckedTargetTransport`` — an httpx transport whose sockets are opened
  against a checked address, so the address described by the check is the
  address the request actually reaches.
